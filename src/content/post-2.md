Teaching in the UK

<h5>Date: 30 December 2015 – 26 October 2016</h5>

<p>
    I worked as a temporary high school teacher at many schools in Newcastle, NSW and I enjoyed the challenge of teaching something new every day. Upon landing a year and a half contract, I was given an art and dance classes, two subjects I knew nothing about. It wasn't something I could just wing either. So, I went an attended a dance class with Newcastle Dance Collective and joined up to an evening art class on the other side of town. Some days I would go straight from school to those classes.

    In the year of 2015, I got an email about teaching in the UK. My fiancé said “well why not?”. So I went through the process of getting a visa, we got married and off we went.

    It was pure chance I got Sevenoaks but glad we did. Such a stunning little town outside of London which definitely earned the name “The Garden of England” or “Magic Kingdom”.

    Dan still had his IT contracts in Australia so he shifted over to working nights while I worked during the day. It was a bit of a challenge but we made it work. First touristy thing we did was go to Knole House. There is a lot of deer running around but don’t feed them, just appreciate them.

    On New Years Day, my friend Tabitha and I went to The Globe Theatre. I nearly cried as it was a dream to visit (yes, English teacher here). Sure, the theatre is a replica and a lot smaller than one would have expected but I was THERE. The tour had a lot of information about past performances and the history. Go early to avoid the crowds. I made a promise to go and see a show sometime later in the year – winter is when they have most of their productions.
