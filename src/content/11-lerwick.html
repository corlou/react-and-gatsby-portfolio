    After spending one night in Dyce, Aberdeen, we caught the overnight ferry
    called “Northlink Ferries” heading to Lerwick. The ride up was smooth and
    pleasant. I was laughing to myself as to how people would have gotten
    seasick on this journey. It was impossible! Reception was bad so we couldn’t
    do any work but thankfully there was nothing urgent. We got a small cabin
    with beds and enjoyed a good night’s sleep.

    Lerwick is a small town in the Shetlands with not much to do, unless you
    were there for their Viking Festival which were sadly not going the be there
    for. I was able to stay up at night for longer and my studies were also
    going well. We came here because of the strange town names (see photos).

    Funny to note that we also wanted to get away from tourists and do things a
    bit off the trail. So, sitting and talking in a cafe watching the seals come
    and go, a voice asks us “are you from Australia?”
  </p>

    We get chatting and it turns out the man we met lived two suburbs away from
    where we were living in Newcastle (Aus). So much for getting away. We ended
    up having dinner with his wife and lovely new daughter. A great home cooked
    meal on a cold and windy night was most welcomed.

    On the way back to Aberdeen, we tried out the sleeping pods on the overnight
    ferry for something different. It was cold and we got really seasick. The
    seas were rough and Dan and I agreed ahead of time which bathroom to use if
    it came to it.
