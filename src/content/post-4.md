<p>
  We missed our flight. Totally my fault. I didn’t account travel time to the airport, even though we stayed at a hotel right near it. So, with an annoyed and tired husband (sorry babe!), we stayed at the airport all day waiting on our next flight.
</p>

<p>
  When we finally arrived in Dublin for the weekend, I realised that I had also made the mistake of not checking exactly where the hotel was in relation to the airport and things to do. We stayed in a lovely hotel... way outside of town.
</p>

<p>
  The next day we caught the bus into town to do a bit of exploring. We came across the “Guinness Storehouse“. There was a huge line outside which lead to another long line inside to buy tickets. It was bitterly cold and windy day.
</p>

<p>
  Suddenly, I had the crazy brilliant idea of connecting to Storehouse’s free Wi-Fi and buying “jump the queue tickets”. It worked!  So, definitely buy tickets online before going there. I won’t give away too many details about the tour but if you want to take your time, it can easily take a whole day. For someone who is not too keen on beer, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of the tour you get a pint Guinness with a 360 degree view of Dublin. It was crowded so we finished up and wandered the streets as the sun was setting before heading back to the hotel and then home again to Sevenoaks.
