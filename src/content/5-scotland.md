Beltane and Scotland

<h5>Date: 30 April- 01 May 2016</h5>

<p>
  As a teenager, I read the Wicca series by Cate Tiernan. Ever since then, I wanted to go to a pagan celebration and what better place than Europe? I did some research and found Beltane in Scotland. It was going to be a short weekend trip so two of our friends joined us.
</p>

<p>
  I did better hotel research and got us one close to the event. Also, after the Ireland disaster, we got to the airport with many hours to spare as I was not going to take any chances.
</p>

<p>
  We got to the celebrations as the sun was setting. Note: DRESS UP. We were dressed for the cold weather but the other festival goers had body paint, glitter, masks, streamers, antlers, fairy wings etc. Maybe it was my expectation of the event after what I read in books but I found this event to be a bit of a let down. I thought that the story of Beltane would be told to the masses and the scenes to be acted out in a field where we could see.

  However, from what we could see, there was a lot of dancing, drumming, and singing. Next time we would get a higher spot, dress warmer, and not go in with certain expectations. Just enjoy it for what it is.

  While in Scotland I did try some haggis. It was actually good, kinda like a sausage roll but without the pastry. Would love to spend more time there.
