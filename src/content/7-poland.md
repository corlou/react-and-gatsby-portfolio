My home away from home (seriously, Poland is great)

<h5>Date: 22 July - mid August 2016</h5>

<p>
  This was a big trip and to cover everything will make this post huge.  So here are the highlights:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>My in-laws came to visit</li>
  <li>Two friends joined us on most of the trip</li>
  <li>Went to Malbork Castle and did a tour</li>
  <li>Visited the Salt Mines in south Poland (really fun experience and great beauty products)</li>
  <li>Was in Kraków for World Youth Day (absolutely packed with people from all over the world and roads blocked off all week)</li>
  <li>Travelled to Hel for a swim (so I can say “I went to Hel and back” or “I went swimming in Hel” NOTE: there were heaps of jellyfish but they don’t sting you.</li>
  <li>Visited Wolf’s Lair – a must go but definitely book a tour and go early to avoid the crowds.</li>
  <li>Auschwitz – a very humbling experience. An upsetting place to visit but everyone should. Take sunscreen in the warmer months and wear comfortable clothing as the tours are long. Do not take photos.</li>
</ul>
